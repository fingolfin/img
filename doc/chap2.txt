  [1X2.1 [33X[0;0YA brief mathematical introduction[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  chapter  assumes  that you have no familiarity with iterated monodromy
  groups.  If  you do, and wish to see their usage within [5XGAP[105X through a sample
  session,  please  skip  to Section [14X2.2[114X. For a more thourough introduction on
  self-similar groups and iterated monodromy groups, see [BGN03] or [Nek05].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBasic  knowledge  of the package [5XFR[105X is assumed, however. Please refer to its
  online documentation, or the same references as above.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  fundamental  objects  are [13XThurston maps[113X: branched self-coverings of the
  sphere  [22XS^2[122X.  These  are  continuous  maps  [22Xf:S^2->  S^2[122X  that, locally, are
  modelled  on  the complex map [22Xzâ†¦ z^n[122X. The [13Xcritical points[113X are those points [22Xz[122X
  at  which  the map is modelled on [22Xzâ†¦ z^n[122X for some [22Xn>1[122X. The [13Xpost-critical set[113X
  is  the union [22XP[122X of strictly forward orbits of critical points. It is assumed
  finite.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTwo    Thurston   maps   [22Xf:(S^2,P)->(S^2,P)[122X   and   [22Xg:(S^2,Q)->(S^2,Q)[122X   are
  [13Xcombinatorially   equivalent[113X   if   they   are  isotopic  through  isotopies
  [22X(S^2,P)->(S^2,Q)[122X that are constant on [22XP[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YDenote  by  [22XG[122X  the  fundamental  group  [22XÏ€_1(S^2âˆ– P,*)[122X at a basepoint [22X*[122X. Then
  combinatorial  equivalence classes of Thurston maps are classified by wreath
  recursions  for [22XG[122X, namely homomorphisms [22XÏ•:G-> Gâ‰€ Sym_d[122X. They are encoded, in
  [5XIMG[105X, by a new kind of FR machine, called a [13Xsphere machine[113X. Generators of the
  machine  correspond  to  loops  in  the  fundamental  group  of  the  sphere
  (punctured  at  post-critical  points),  that  circle once counter-clockwise
  around a post-critical point.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBy  a  fundamental theorem of Thurston, every Thurston map (apart from a few
  low-complexity  examples) is either combinatorially equivalent to a rational
  map,  or  is [13Xobstructed[113X: there exists a system of curves on [22XS^2âˆ– P[122X with some
  appropriate non-contraction property.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  operations  in  this  package  let one manipulate Thurston maps, and in
  particular[133X

  [33X[0;0YThis  is a brief introduction describing some of the simpler features of the
  [5XIMG[105X  package. It assumes you have some familiarity with the theory of groups
  defined  by  automata, and of holomorphic dynamical systems; if not, a brief
  mathematical  introduction  may  be  found  in Section [14X2.1[114X. We show here and
  comment a typical use of the package.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  package  is installed by unpacking the archive in the [11Xpkg/[111X directory of
  your  [5XGAP[105X  installation.  It  can also be placed in a local directory, which
  must be added to the load-path by invoking [10Xgap[110X with the [10X-l[110X option.[133X

  [33X[0;0YWe  have just created the basilica machine, with group [22XG=âŸ¨ f1,f2,f3|f3f2f1âŸ©[122X,
  and computed the corresponding rational map.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  now compute the mating of the basilica with itself: that is the Thurston
  map  which  acts  as [22Xz^2-1[122X on the upper hemisphere, by angle doubling on the
  equator,  and  also as [22Xz^2-1[122X on the lower hemisphere. It turns out that this
  map  is  obstructed, i.e. does not have a realization as a rational map. The
  obstruction  consists  of  a  curve  separating  the points [22X-1[122X and [22X0[122X on both
  hemispheres:[133X
